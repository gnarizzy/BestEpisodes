                        <h4><strong>How does Rate {{artist}} work?</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                You are shown two randomly selected songs, and you choose the better one (or say they're equally good).
                                Behind the scenes, the site aggregates these selections and uses the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org
                                /wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating system</a> to provide accurate song rankings. It
                                was originally created (and modified versions are still used) for ranking chess players, and is now used
                                in many games today.
                                <br><br>
                                Each time you make a choice, the Elo rating algorithm treats it as a "match" between those two songs.
                                By aggregating the results for every song and recalculating the rating after each match, it's possible to
                                produce a data-driven rankings list that not only tells you which songs are the best, but also how much
                                better they are than any other given song.
                            </p>
                        <h4><strong>Why is this better than the 1 through 10 ratings?</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                It's better primarily because when humans don't have a consistent internal rating system to use when they are asked
                                to give quantitative ratings. Imagine the best pizza place you've ever been to. Presumably, that pizza is
                                a 10/10. But what happens if tomorrow you come across an even better pizza place? Does the old pizzeria
                                drop to 9/10? And what if you were in a bad mood when you rated it, or had just eaten pizza the night
                                before and were kind of sick of pizza when you tried it, etc.? It's much easier to say, Pizzeria A is
                                better than Pizzeria B than it is to explicitly say Pizzeria A is a 9/10 and Pizzeria B is a 7.5/10.
                                <br><br>
                                We can create more accurate and constantly up-to-date rankings by using implicit qualitative preferences
                                than explicit quantitative (but actually more arbitrary) ratings. And, the Elo algorithm allows us to
                                predict the exact probability that any song will "defeat" any other song! There are some drawbacks to this approach,
                                namely that each singular new vote carries the same weight regardless of how many previous votes have been placed, which
                                suggests perhaps a simple thumbs up/thumbs down percentage may be more accurate.
